Weather
- Catastrophic (100 disconnessioni/sec , squad output -100%)
- Bad (20 disconnessioni/sec, squad output -30%)
- Acceptable (5 disconnessioni/sec, squad output nominale)
- Perfect (0 disc/sec, squad output +50%)
[numeri to be tuned]


Squad activity%: ~60% -> 70 avg. squads active, -10% for weather-correcting optimal play
Total gen: -3000
12min of play is 80k to 65: -15k total
3k is gens
12min of 70 squads active in Acceptable weather is, roughly, +32k at 1/sec
with Acceptable weather of -5/sec, 2700 are lost - to balance out, further small periods of Catastrophic are needed, and the remaining split roughly evenly between Bad and Acceptable

Optimal play is, without gens, roughly, per minute, 2600
Catastrophic: -6000
Bad: +1000
Acceptable: +2300
Perfect: +3800





0-1 min: Catastrophic Weather
Artificial spike:
0-30s -> +6k / sec
30-60s: -> -3k / sec (automatismi & telecontrolli)
